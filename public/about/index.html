    <p>Ian Milligan (he/him) is a digital historian and Professor of History at the University of Waterloo, where he is currently serving as a full-time academic administrator.</p>
<p>Milligan&rsquo;s research explores how web archives and other born-digital traces can be used as historical evidence and how they are transforming historical practice. His most recent book, <em>Averting the Digital Dark Age: How Archivists, Librarians, and Technologists Built the Web a Memory</em> (Johns Hopkins, 2024), builds on earlier monographs: <em>The Transformation of Historical Research in the Digital Age</em> (2022), <em>History in the Age of Abundance</em> (2019), and <em>Rebel Youth</em> (2014). He also co-authored <em>Exploring Big Historical Data</em> (2015) and co-edited the <em>SAGE Handbook of Web History</em> (2018). From 2017 to 2023 he was principal investigator of the <a href="https://archivesunleashed.org">Archives Unleashed</a> project, now offered as a <a href="https://archive-it.org/arch/">service</a> by the Internet Archive, and he is co-editor of the journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rint20"><em>Internet Histories</em></a>. Currently, he sits on several advisory boards such as the Canadian Commission for UNESCO&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.ccunesco.ca/initiatives/memory-of-the-world">Memory of the World Advisory Committee</a> and the UCLA Library&rsquo;s <a href="https://meap.library.ucla.edu">Modern Endangered Archives Program</a> (MEAP) board.</p>
<p>Milligan currently serves as Associate Vice-President, Research Oversight &amp; Analysis at Waterloo, providing campus leadership for research integrity and compliance. His portfolio includes the Office of Research Ethics, safeguarding research, inclusive research, research health &amp; safety, bibliometrics, emergency research issues, and campus research awards.
