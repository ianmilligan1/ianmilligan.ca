This project seeks to identify the cultural, intellectual, and theoretical factors during the early 1990s which contributed to the momentous decision to pursue ambitious and widespread web archiving. Secondly, it traces the technical development of new web archiving systems from the "digital dark age" worries of 1995 to the sophisticated systems developed in 1996, particularly at the Internet Archive. Finally, it will assess the accessibility, effectiveness, and impact of these new web archiving systems using the attacks of September 11th, 2001 -- a major historical event accompanied by intense online activity -- as a case study.
