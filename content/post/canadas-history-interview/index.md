I was recently interviewed by [Joanna Dawson](https://twitter.com/jo_dawson?lang=en) of _Canada's History_ magazine. The focus was primarily on my recent book [_History in the Age of Abundance?_](/publication/history-in-the-age-of-abundance) but also about digital history and what it means to be a historian in the 21st-century more generally. 

A shorter version will appear in the next print edition, but you can read the full un-cut interview [online](https://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/books/the-past-is-now-digital). My sincerest thanks to Joanna and to _Canada's History_ for the chance to talk about something I'm so passionate about.
