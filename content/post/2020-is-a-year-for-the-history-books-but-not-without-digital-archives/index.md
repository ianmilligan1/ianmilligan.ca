<p>A seasonal change is in the air. With a minimal amount of nostalgia about the dwindling days of this unique summer, let’s turn to how we can make the most of the rest of 2020 — clearly a year for the history books. </p>

<p>As a historian, what concerns me is: What will our history of this unprecedented year look like in a quarter century? As the world is <a href="https://ipolitics.ca/2020/04/14/how-covid-19-will-reshape-global-politics/">reshaped by COVID-19</a>, as well as ongoing protests on a nearly unprecedented scale against racism and police brutality in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/us/kenosha-police-shooting.html">United States</a>, <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadian-protesters-march-against-racism-from-coast-to-coast-1.4972882">Canada and</a> around the world, it’s clear that this will be a year for future historians to make sense of. </p>

<p>A child today will be a historian of 2020 in the future. What sources will they turn to? How will they verify scattered memories? How will people tell the story of the tumultuous times that we’re living in today? 2020 may be a year for the history “books” but of course, <a href="https://theconversation.com/historians-archival-research-looks-quite-different-in-the-digital-age-121096">the record we leave behind will be digital in manner</a>. </p>

<p>But right now, Canada, unlike many other countries such as the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/legal-deposit/web-archiving">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.bnf.fr/fr/archives-de-linternet">France</a>, <a href="http://netarkivet.dk/in-english/">Denmark</a> and others, doesn’t mandate its national library to capture a comprehensive digital record of Canadian life. This needs to change so we can ensure historians of the future have all the sources possible to write a rich, equitable and robust historical record. </p>

<h2>Social movements, virus</h2>

<p>From the role of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/technology/social-media-protests.html">video and social media in sparking and documenting protests</a> to <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-how-td-transformed-its-high-tech-trading-floor-into-a-virtual/">companies</a> and <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2020/03/17/shifting-unexpectedly-remote-instruction-requires-many-human-solutions-tech">educational institutions</a> that moved online en masse in a matter of days this past March, 2020 will be a year that will be understood through digital media.  </p>

<p>With coronavirus isolation, <a href="https://communication.illinois.edu/news/2020-04-10/professor-john-caughlin-navigating-relationships-and-technology-during-covid-19">digital media has been enormously important for our interactions with colleagues, friends and loved ones</a>. </p>

<p>Some trends: Zoom’s daily meeting participants went from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277006/zoom-q1-2021-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-work-from-home">10 million in December to 300 million in April</a> and we <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/">“doomscroll”</a> through social media feeds before bed. As <em>The New York Times</em> explained: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/07/technology/coronavirus-internet-use.html">“The virus changed the way we internet.”</a></p>

<h2>Minute-by-minute information</h2>

<p>Because in part the British Library is <a href="https://www.bl.uk/legal-deposit/web-archiving">empowered to collect millions of their web pages every year</a> through the use of “legal deposit” power, a historian in the U.K. will have a rich record to explore.</p>

<p>For example, what did Britons think of senior adviser Dominic Cummings’ 418-kilometre <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52811168">trip from London to Durham</a> while his wife was unwell? A researcher will be able to visit the British Library (in most cases, an <a href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/en/ukwa/info/faq">in-person visit is required</a> due to legal reasons) to consult not only social media feeds of everyday researchers, but news websites, U.K. blogs <a href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/en/ukwa/collection/2446">and beyond</a>. </p>

<p>They will be able to draw on nearly everything published on the U.K. web in 2020. Right now a researcher can already view thousands of pages — and, most importantly, these are stewarded by the British Library for future preservation.</p>

<h2>Legal deposit</h2>

<p>This information will be accessible to our future researcher thanks to the power of legal deposit. Legal deposit is <a href="https://www.ifla.org/node/8303">defined by the International Federation of Library Associations</a> as a “statutory obligation [that] requires publishers, distributors and, in some countries, printers, to freely provide copies of their publications to the national collection,” and is a power that builds the collections of national libraries including <a href="https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/legal-deposit/Pages/legal-deposit.aspx">Library and Archives Canada</a> (LAC).</p>

<p>What this has meant in practice is that when a book or publication is published, there has been a legal requirement to deposit the book with a national library.</p>

<p>What happens when a publication moves <em>online</em>? What about blogs? Should they have a similar responsibility to deposit their material? And, critically, does a national library have a duty to preserve this information at scale?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a> has, since April 2013, been “<a href="https://www.bl.uk/legal-deposit/web-archiving">entitled to copy U.K.-published material from the internet for archiving under legal deposit</a>.” In practice, this means that it annually archives websites of the U.K.; it also supplements this archive through curated collections such as the earlier mentioned one around <a href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/en/ukwa/collection/2446">global pandemics</a>. Those tweets, blogs, health websites and so on all form part of the historical record — and once archived, there is no legal ability to retroactively delete them.</p>

<p>Crucially, sweeping collections of material under legal deposit means that material is being amassed that does not seem important <em>today</em>   — but could be invaluable to a historian in years to come.</p>

<h2>Canada should aggressively follow</h2>

<p>The remarkably forward thinking <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-7.7/"><em>Library and Archives of Canada Act</em></a> of 2004 gives Library and Archives Canada similar powers. <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-7.7/page-1.html#h-345269">One section of the act</a>, for example, gives the institution the power to take a “representative sample of the documentary material of interest to Canada that is accessible to the public without restriction through the internet or any similar medium.”</p>

<p>These laws, however, aren’t used to their fullest. Canada’s national library doesn’t carry out a comprehensive snapshot of the entire Canadian web domain, meaning that countless voices will be lost for future historians.</p>

<p>This is not to paint too dire a picture. Library and Archives Canada does a great job of capturing material of interest. During COVID-19, it has selectively captured some <a href="https://netpreserveblog.wordpress.com/2020/07/15/documenting-covid-19-and-the-great-confinement-in-canada/">38 million digital assets related to COVID-19 by July 2020</a>, which add to their robust web archives including the Government of Canada web archive, which collects and maintains a comprehensive record of federal government’s websites. </p>

<p>Increasingly, it’s making collections, such as <a href="https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/aboriginal-heritage/Pages/truth-reconciliation-commission-web-archive.aspx">the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s</a> collection, available online. In doing so, Library and Archives Canada is explicitly noting its collecting powers under the 2004 act, suggesting an increasing willingness to share these materials. </p>

<p>We should laud this great work, and use it as a launchpad for the comprehensive collection of all Canadian material.</p>

<h2>Patchwork collecting: not enough</h2>

<p>While Library and Archives Canada has been collecting material for COVID-19, including social media hashtags as well as media and non-media related websites, even <a href="https://netpreserveblog.wordpress.com/2020/07/15/documenting-covid-19-and-the-great-confinement-in-canada/">900 websites being regularly collected</a> is patchwork compared to the sheer amount of information published by Canadians online every day. </p>

<p>To do justice to what’s happening around us, and to make sure that historians of the future can understand this moment, the institution and policy-makers need to move quickly. </p>

<p>We need to aim to collect the entire Canadian web domain on an ongoing basis, both during and after COVID, to enable future researchers to understand our country. This will require additional funds to Library and Archives Canada. But, at what better time?<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.
