A nice review in [*Choice Reviews*](https://www.choicereviews.org) by [Charles Tappert](http://csis.pace.edu/~ctappert/) at Pace University. To sum, [_The SAGE Handbook of Web History_](/publication/sage-handbook/) (co-edited by Niels Br√ºgger and myself) is "highly recommended" and actually listed as a "top 75" choice for two-year colleges. 

Tappert describes our book as "a wonderful guide to virtual life since the development of the World Wide Web," noting its a "monumental tome" that's "an excellent handbook for acquisition by university and local libraries." 

I don't think there's any easy way to link to *Choice*, but there you have it!
