After ten years of blogging ([seriously](https://ianmilli.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/the-role-of-historical-monographs/
)) at the WordPress.com version of ianmilligan.ca, the time has come for a new look and platform for my site! 

This change has been a long time coming (the new WordPress.com editor annoyed me; my relative frequency of blogging has dropped off making a blog-centric platform less appealing; and paying to get rid of advertisements, etc. on a yearly basis). I did a bit of looking into migrating the content to this, but well, with the recent release of [*History in the Age of Abundance*](https://ianmilligan.ca/2009/11/30/the-role-of-historical-monographs/
), my focus on the [Archives Unleashed project](https://ianmilligan.ca/2009/11/30/the-role-of-historical-monographs/
), and my own shifting interests, it seemed to make sense to leave the old <https://ianmilli.wordpress.com> site alive and start fresh here.
