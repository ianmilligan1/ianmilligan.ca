Excerpted from a [recent story](https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/news/archives-unleashed-project-scales-archive-it-better) about our new exciting project: 

>The [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/) has awarded a $1,084,087 CAD grant to the University of Waterloo to support the “Integrating Archives Unleashed Cloud with Archive-It” project. Led by Professor [Ian Milligan](https://www.ianmilligan.ca/), from the University of Waterloo’s Department of History, alongside co-investigators [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/), Professor and Cheriton Chair at Waterloo’s Cheriton School of Computer Science, [Nick Ruest](https://ruebot.net/), Digital Assets Librarian in the Digital Scholarship Infrastructure department of York University Libraries, and Jefferson Bailey, Director of Web Archiving & Data Services at the Internet Archive, this project represents the next stage of the [Archives Unleashed](https://archivesunleashed.org/) Project. With this funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the project hopes to bridge the current gulf between web archiving collection, access, and data-driven analysis.
